# Architecture

* _Updated: December 2021_

This document describes the repository organization and the kustomize
build process. It's meant to lower the barrier to learning and
contributing to the code base.

If not kept up to date, it will just be a historical snapshot.

## Modules

[semantically versioned]: https://semver.org
[Go modules]: https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules

The [Go modules] in the kustomize repository are [semantically versioned].


### `kustomize`

> _Depends on [`api`], [`cmd/config`], [`kyaml`]_

The [`kustomize` module] contains the `main.go` for `kustomize`, buildable with

```
(cd kustomize; go install .)
```

[appears in kubectl]: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/staging/src/k8s.io/kubectl/pkg/cmd/kustomize/kustomize.go

Below this are packages containing
[cobra](http://github.com/spf13/cobra) commands implementing `build`,
`edit`, `fix`, etc., packages linked together by `main.go`.

These command packages are intentionally public, semantically
versioned, and can be used in other programs.  Specifically, the
`kustomize build` command [appears in kubectl] as `kubectl kustomize`.

The code in the `build` package is dominated by flag validation,
with minimal business logic.  The critical lines are something
like

```
# Make a kustomizer.
k := krusty.MakeKustomizer(
  HonorKustomizeFlags(krusty.MakeDefaultOptions()),
)

# Run the kustomizer, sending location of kustomization.yaml
m := k.Run(fSys, "/path/to/dir")

# Write the result as YAML.
writer.Write(m.AsYaml())
```

The `krusty` package is in the [`api`] module.

### `api`

> _Depends on [`kyaml`] and code generated from builtin plugin modules_

The [`api` module] is used by CLI programs like `kustomize` and `kubectl`
to read and honor `kustomization.yaml` files and all that implies.

The main public packages in the [`api` module] are

 | package   |             |
 | --------: | :---------- |
 | `filters` | Implementations of [`kyaml/kio.Filter`] used by kustomize to transform Kubernetes objects. |
 |  `konfig` | Configuration methods and constants in the kustomize API. |
 |  `krusty` | Primary API entry point.  Holds the kustomizer and hundreds of tests for it. |
 |  `loader` | Loads kustomization files and the files they refer to, enforcing security rules. |
 |  `resmap` | The primary internal data structure over which the kustomizer and filters work. |
 |   `types` | The `Kustomization` object and ancillary structs. |

### `cmd/config`

> _Depends on [`kyaml`]_

This module contains cobra commands and kyaml-based functionality to
provide unix-like file manipulation commands to kustomize like `grep`
and `tree`.  These commands may be included in any program that
manipulates k8s YAML (e.g. kustomize).

### `kyaml`

> _Has no in-repo dependence_

The [`kyaml` module] is a kubernetes-focussed enhancement of [go-yaml].

The YAML manipulation performed by a kustomize is based on these libraries.

These libraries evolve independently of kustomize, and other programs depend on them.

The key public packages in the [`kyaml` module] include

 | package   |             |
 | --------: | :---------- |
 | `errors` | Wrapper for the go-errors/errors lib |
 | `filesys` | A kustomize-specific file system abstraction, to ease writing tests |
 | `fn/framework` | An SDK for writing KRM Functions in Go |
 | `fn/runtime` | Implements the runtime for KRM Function extensions |
 | `kio` | Libraries for reading and writing collections of Kubernetes resources as RNodes |
 | `openapi` | Loads and accesses openapi schemas for schema-aware resource manipultaion |
 | `resid` | Representations to aid in unique identification of Kubernetes resources |
 | `yaml` | A Kubernetes-focused wrapper of [go-yaml], notably including the RNode object |

## How _kustomize build_ works

The command `kustomize build` accepts a single string argument,
which must resolve to a directory, possibly in a git repository,
called the _kustomization root_.

This directory must contain a file called `kustomization.yaml`, with
YAML that marshals into a single instance of a `Kustomization` object.

For the remainder of this document, the word _kustomization_ refers to
either of these things.

This kustomization is the access point to a directed, acyclic graph of
Kubernetes objects, including other kustomizations, to include in a
build.

Execution of `build` starts and ends in the [`api`] module,
frequently dipping into the [`kyaml`] module for lower level
YAML manipulation.

### The `build` flow

  - Validate command lines arguments and flags.

  - Make a `Kustomizer` as a function of those arguments.

  - Call `Run` on the kustomizer, passing it the path to the
    kustomization.

    `Run` returns an instance of `ResMap`, the `api` package's
    representation of a set of kubernetes `Resource` objects.

    This structure offers resource lookup methods (map behavior),
    but also retains the resources in the order they were
    specified in kustomization files (list behavior).

    Post-run, the objects are fully hydrated, per the
    instructions in the kustomization.

  - Marshal the objects as YAML to a file or `stdout`.


### The `Run` function

  - Create various objects

    - A `ResMap` factory.

      Makes  `ResMaps` from byte streams, other `ResMaps`, etc.

    - A file `loader.Loader`.

      It's fed an appropriate set of restrictions, and the path to the kustomization.

    - A plugin loader.

      It finds plugins (transformers, generators or validators)
      and prepares them for running.

    - A `KustTarget` encapsulating all of the above.

      A KustTarget contains one `Kustomization` and represents
	  everything that kustomization can reach.  This will include
	  other `KustTarget` instances, each having a smaller purview than
	  the one referencing it.

  - Call `KustTarget.Load` to load its kustomization.

    This step deals with deprecations and field changes.

  - Load [openapi] data specified by the kustomization.

    This is needed to recognize k8s kinds and their special
    properties, e.g. which kinds are cluster-scoped, which kinds
    refer to others, etc.

  - Call `KustTarget.makeCustomizedResmap` to create the `ResMap` result.

    This visits everything referenced by the kustomization,
    performing all generation, transformation and validation.

  - Finish the `Run` with

    - Optional reordering of objects in `ResMap`, overriding the
      FIFO rule.

    - Optional addition of _kustomize build annotations_ to the
      resources.  E.g. from which repo and file the resource was
      read, the fact that kustomize touched the resource, etc.
      These kustomize-specific annotations are intended for
      server-side data analytics, file structure traceability and
      reconstruction, etc.

### The `makeCustomizedResmap` function

  This function starts the process of object transformation,
  as well as accumulation of recursively referenced data.

  - Call `ra := KustTarget.AccumulateTarget`.

    The result, `ra`, is a resource accumulator that contains
    everything referred to by the current kustomization, now fully
    hydrated.

  - Uniquify names of generated objects by appending content hashes.

    This cannot be done until the objects are complete.

  - Fix all name references (given that names may have changed).

    E.g. if a ConfigMaps was given a generated name, all objects that
    refer to that ConfigMap must be given its name.

  - Resolve vars, replacing them with whatever they refer to (a legacy feature).

### The `AccumulateTarget` function

  - Call `AccumulateResources` over the `resources` field (this can recurse).
  - Call `AccumulateComponents` over the `components` field (this can recurse),
  - Load legacy (pre-plugin) global kustomize configuration,
  - Load legacy (pre-openapi) _Custom Resource Definition_ data.
  - In the context of the data loaded above, run the kustomization's
    - generators,
    - transformers,
    - and validators.
  - Accumulate `vars` (make note of them for later replacement).

### `AccumulateResources` and component accumulation

  - If the path is a file:
    - Accumulate the objects in the file (treating them
      as opaque kubernetes objects).

  - If the path is a directory:
    - Create a new `KustTarget` referring to that directory's kustomization.
	- Call `subRa := KustTarget.AccumulateTarget`.
    - Call `ra.MergeAccumulator(subRa)`
	This completes a recursion.

  - If the path is a git URL:
    - Clone the repository to a temporary directory.
    - Process the path optionally specified in the URL
      as a path in the clone.
	- If no path specified, work from the repository root.


That's as deep as this discussion will go.

The deeper this document goes into the details, the faster
it will get out of date.
